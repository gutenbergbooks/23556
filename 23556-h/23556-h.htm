      HIS UNQUIET GHOST
    </h1>

    </p>
    <p>
      The moon was high in the sky. The wind was laid. So silent was the vast
      stretch of mountain wilderness, aglint with the dew, that the tinkle of a
      rill far below in the black abyss seemed less a sound than an evidence of
      the pervasive quietude, since so slight a thing, so distant, could compass
      so keen a vibration. For an hour or more the three men who lurked in the
      shadow of a crag in the narrow mountain-pass, heard nothing else. When at
      last they caught the dull reverberation of a slow wheel and the occasional
      metallic clank of a tire against a stone, the vehicle was fully three
      miles distant by the winding road in the valley. Time lagged. Only by
      imperceptible degrees the sound of deliberate approach grew louder on the
      air as the interval of space lessened. At length, above their ambush at
      the summit of the mountain's brow the heads of horses came into view,
      distinct in the moonlight between the fibrous pines and the vast expanse
      of the sky above the valley. Even then there was renewed delay. The driver
      of the wagon paused to rest the team.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three lurking men did not move; they scarcely ventured to breathe.
      Only when there was no retrograde possible, no chance of escape, when the
      vehicle was fairly on the steep declivity of the road, the precipice sheer
      on one side, the wall of the ridge rising perpendicularly on the other,
      did two of them, both revenue-raiders disguised as mountaineers, step
      forth from the shadow. The other, the informer, a genuine mountaineer,
      still skulked motionless in the darkness. The &ldquo;revenuers,&rdquo; ascending the
      road, maintained a slow, lunging gait, as if they had toiled from far.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their abrupt appearance had the effect of a galvanic shock to the man
      handling the reins, a stalwart, rubicund fellow, who visibly paled. He
      drew up so suddenly as almost to throw the horses from their feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;G'evenin',&rdquo; ventured Browdie, the elder of the raiders, in a husky voice
      affecting an untutored accent. He had some special ability as a mimic,
      and, being familiar with the dialect and manners of the people, this gift
      greatly facilitated the rustic impersonation he had essayed. &ldquo;Ye're
      haulin' late,&rdquo; he added, for the hour was close to midnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, stranger; haulin' late, from Eskaqua&mdash;a needcessity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's yer cargo?&rdquo; asked Browdie, seeming only ordinarily inquisitive.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sepulchral cadence was in the driver's voice, and the disguised raiders
      noted that the three other men on the wagon had preserved, throughout, a
      solemn silence. &ldquo;What we-uns mus' all be one day, stranger&mdash;a
      corpus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Browdie was stultified for a moment Then, sustaining his assumed
      character, he said: &ldquo;I hope it be nobody I know. I be fairly well
      acquainted in Eskaqua, though I hail from down in Lonesome Cove. Who be
      dead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was palpably a moment's hesitation before the spokesman replied:
      &ldquo;Watt Wyatt; died day 'fore yestiddy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the words, one of the silent men in the wagon turned his face suddenly,
      with such obvious amazement depicted upon it that it arrested the
      attention of the &ldquo;rev-enuers.&rdquo; This face was so individual that it was not
      likely to be easily mistaken or forgotten. A wild, breezy look it had, and
      a tricksy, incorporeal expression that might well befit some fantastic,
      fabled thing of the woods. It was full of fine script of elusive meanings,
      not registered in the lineaments of the prosaic man of the day, though
      perchance of scant utility, not worth interpretation. His full gray eyes
      were touched to glancing brilliancy by a moonbeam; his long, fibrously
      floating brown hair was thrown backward; his receding chin was peculiarly
      delicate; and though his well-knit frame bespoke a hardy vigor, his pale
      cheek was soft and thin. All the rustic grotesquery of garb and posture
      was cancelled by the deep shadow of a bough, and his delicate face showed
      isolated in the moonlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Browdie silently pondered his vague suspicions for a moment &ldquo;Whar did he
      die at?&rdquo; he then demanded at a venture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At his daddy's house, fur sure. Whar else?&rdquo; responded the driver. &ldquo;I hev
      got what's lef' of him hyar in the coffin-box. We expected ter make it ter
      Shiloh buryin'-ground 'fore dark; but the road is middlin' heavy, an'
      'bout five mile' back Ben cast a shoe. The funeral warn't over much 'fore
      noon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whyn't they bury him in Eskaqua, whar he died!&rdquo; persisted Browdie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Waal, they planned ter bury him alongside his mother an' gran'dad, what
      used ter live in Tanglefoot Cove. But we air wastin' time hyar, an' we hev
      got none ter spare. Gee, Ben! Git up, John!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The wagon gave a lurch; the horses, holding back in bracing attitudes far
      from the pole, went teetering down the steep slant, the locked wheel
      dragging heavily; the four men sat silent, two in slouching postures at
      the head of the coffin; the third, with the driver, was at its foot. It
      seemed drearily suggestive, the last journey of this humble mortality, in
      all the splendid environment of the mountains, under the vast expansions
      of the aloof skies, in the mystic light of the unnoting moon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this bona-fide?&rdquo; asked Browdie, with a questioning glance at the
      informer, who had at length crept forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dunno,&rdquo; sullenly responded the mountaineer. He had acquainted the two
      officers, who were of a posse of revenue-raiders hovering in the vicinity,
      with the mysterious circumstance that a freighted wagon now and then made
      a midnight transit across these lonely ranges. He himself had heard only
      occasionally in a wakeful hour the roll of heavy wheels, but he
      interpreted this as the secret transportation of brush whisky from the
      still to its market. He had thought to fix the transgression on an old
      enemy of his own, long suspected of moonshining; but he was acquainted
      with none of the youngsters on the wagon, at whom he had peered cautiously
      from behind the rocks. His actuating motive in giving information to the
      emissaries of the government had been the rancor of an old feud, and his
      detection meant certain death. He had not expected the revenue-raiders to
      be outnumbered by the supposed moonshiners, and he would not fight in the
      open. He had no sentiment of fealty to the law, and the officers glanced
      at each other in uncertainty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This evidently is not the wagon in question,&rdquo; said Browdie, disappointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll follow them a bit,&rdquo; volunteered Bonan, the younger and the more
      active of the two officers. &ldquo;Seems to me they'll bear watching.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, as the melancholy cort√®ge fared down and down the steep road,
      dwindling in the sheeny distance, the covert and half-suppressed laughter
      of the sepulchral escort was of so keen a relish that it was well that the
      scraping of the locked wheel aided the distance to mask the incongruous
      sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What ailed you-uns ter name <i>me</i> as the corpus, 'Gene Barker?&rdquo;
       demanded Walter Wyatt, when he had regained the capacity of coherent
      speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I hed ter do suddint murder on somebody,&rdquo; declared the driver, all
      bluff and reassured and red-faced again, &ldquo;an' I couldn't think quick of
      nobody else. Besides, I helt a grudge agin' you fer not stuffin' mo' straw
      'twixt them jimmyjohns in the coffin-box.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a fac'. Ye air too triflin' ter be let ter live, Watt,&rdquo; cried one
      of their comrades. &ldquo;I hearn them jugs clash tergether in the coffin-box
      when 'Gene checked the team up suddint, I tell you. An' them men sure
      'peared ter me powerful suspectin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I</i> hearn the clash of them jimmyjohns,&rdquo; chimed in the driver. &ldquo;I
      really thunk my hour war come. Some informer must hev set them men ter
      spyin' round fer moonshine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, surely nobody wouldn't dare,&rdquo; urged one of the group, uneasily; for
      the identity of an informer was masked in secrecy, and his fate, when
      discovered, was often gruesome.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They couldn't hev noticed the clash of them jimmyjohns, nohow,&rdquo; declared
      the negligent Watt, nonchalantly. &ldquo;But namin' <i>me</i> fur the dead one!
      Supposin' they air revenuers fur true, an' hed somebody along, hid out in
      the bresh, ez war acquainted with me by sight&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then they'd hev been skeered out'n thar boots, that's all,&rdquo; interrupted
      the self-sufficient 'Gene. &ldquo;They would hev 'lowed they hed viewed yer
      brazen ghost, bold ez brass, standin' at the head of yer own coffin-box.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or mebbe they mought hev recognized the Wyatt favor, ef they warn't
      acquainted with <i>me</i>,&rdquo; persisted Watt, with his unique sense of
      injury.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eugene Barker defended the temerity of his inspiration. &ldquo;They would hev
      jes thought ye war kin ter the deceased, an' at-tendin' him ter his long
      home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Gene don't keer much fur ye ter be alive nohow, Watt Wyatt,&rdquo; one of the
      others suggested tactlessly, &ldquo;'count o' Minta Elladine Biggs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eugene Barker's off-hand phrase was incongruous with his sudden gravity
      and his evident rancor as he declared: &ldquo;<i>I</i> ain't carin' fur sech ez
      Watt Wyatt. An' they <i>do</i> say in the cove that Minta Elladine Biggs
      hev gin him the mitten, anyhow, on account of his gamesome ways, playin'
      kyerds, a-bet-tin' his money, drinkin' apple-jack, an' sech.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The newly constituted ghost roused himself with great vitality as if to
      retort floutingly; but as he turned, his jaw suddenly fell; his eyes
      widened with a ghastly distension. With an unsteady arm extended he
      pointed silently. Distinctly outlined on the lid of-the coffin was the
      simulacrum of the figure of aman.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of his comrades, seated on the tailboard of the wagon, had discerned a
      significance in the abrupt silence. As he turned, he, too, caught a
      fleeting glimpse of that weird image on the coffin-lid. But he was of a
      more mundane pulse. The apparition roused in him only a wonder whence
      could come this shadow in the midst of the moon-flooded road. He lifted
      his eyes to the verge of the bluff above, and there he descried an
      indistinct human form, which suddenly disappeared as he looked, and at
      that moment the simulacrum vanished from the lid of the box.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mystery was of instant elucidation. They were suspected, followed. The
      number of their pursuers of course they could not divine, but at least one
      of the revenue-officers had trailed the wagon between the precipice and
      the great wall of the ascent on the right, which had gradually dwindled to
      a diminished height. Deep gullies were here and there washed out by recent
      rains, and one of these indentations might have afforded an active man
      access to the summit. Thus the pursuer had evidently kept abreast of them,
      speeding along in great leaps through the lush growth of huckleberry
      bushes, wild grasses, pawpaw thickets, silvered by the moon, all fringing
      the great forests that had given way on the shelving verge of the steeps
      where the road ran. Had he overheard their unguarded, significant words?
      Who could divine, so silent were the windless mountains, so deep a-dream
      the darksome woods, so spellbound the mute and mystic moonlight?
    </p>
    <p>
      The group maintained a cautious reticence now, each revolving the
      problematic disclosure of their secret, each canvassing the question
      whether the pursuer himself was aware of his betrayal of his stealthy
      proximity. Not till they had reached the ford of the river did they
      venture on a low-toned colloquy. The driver paused in midstream and
      stepped out on the pole between the horses to let down the check-reins, as
      the team manifested an inclination to drink in transit; and thence, as he
      stood thus perched, he gazed to and fro, the stretch of dark and lustrous
      ripples baffling all approach within ear-shot, the watering of the horses
      justifying the pause and cloaking its significance to any distant
      observer.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the interval was indeed limited; the mental processes of such men are
      devoid of complexity, and their decisions prompt. They advanced few
      alternatives; their prime object was to be swiftly rid of the coffin and
      its inculpating contents, and with the &ldquo;revenuer&rdquo; so hard on their heels
      this might seem a troublous problem enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put it whar a coffin b'longs&mdash;in the churchyard,&rdquo; said Wyatt; for at
      a considerable distance beyond the rise of the opposite bank could be seen
      a barren clearing in which stood a gaunt, bare, little white frame
      building that served all the country-side for its infrequent religious
      services.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We couldn't dig a grave before that spy&mdash;ef he be a revenuer sure
      enough&mdash;could overhaul us,&rdquo; Eugene Barker objected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We could turn the yearth right smart, though,&rdquo; persisted Wyatt, for
      pickax and shovel had been brought in the wagon for the sake of an aspect
      of verisimilitude and to mask their true intent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eugene Barker acceded to this view. &ldquo;That's the dinctum&mdash;dig a few
      jes fer a blind. We kin slip the coffin-box under the church-house 'fore
      he gits in sight,&mdash;he'll be feared ter follow too close,&mdash;an'
      leave it thar till the other boys kin wagon it ter the cross-roads' store
      ter-morrer night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The horses, hitherto held to the sober gait of funeral travel, were now
      put to a speedy trot, unmindful of whatever impression of flight the pace
      might give to the revenue-raider in pursuit. The men were soon engrossed
      in their deceptive enterprise in the churchyard, plying pickax and shovel
      for dear life; now and again they paused to listen vainly for the sound of
      stealthy approach. They knew that there was the most precarious and
      primitive of foot-bridges across the deep stream, to traverse which would
      cost an unaccustomed wayfarer both time and pains; thus the interval was
      considerable before the resonance of rapid footfalls gave token that their
      pursuer had found himself obliged to sprint smartly along the country road
      to keep any hope of ever again' viewing the wagon which the intervening
      water-course had withdrawn from his sight. That this hope had grown
      tenuous was evident in his relinquishment of his former caution, for when
      they again caught a glimpse of him he was forging along in the middle of
      the road without any effort at concealment. But as the wagon appeared in
      the perspective, stationary, hitched to the hedge of the graveyard, he
      recurred to his previous methods. The four men still within the
      in-closure, now busied in shovelling the earth back again into the
      excavation they had so swiftly made, covertly watched him as he skulked
      into the shadow of the wayside. The little &ldquo;church-house,&rdquo; with all its
      windows whitely aglare in the moonlight, reflected the pervasive sheen,
      and silent, spectral, remote, it seemed as if it might well harbor at
      times its ghastly neighbors from the quiet cemetery without, dimly ranging
      themselves once more in the shadowy ranks of its pews or grimly stalking
      down the drear and deserted aisles. The fact that the rising ground toward
      the rear of the building necessitated a series of steps at the entrance,
      enabled the officer to mask behind this tall flight his crouching
      approach, and thus he ensconced himself in the angle between the wall and
      the steps, and looked forth in fancied security.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shadows multiplied the tale of the dead that the head-boards kept,
      each similitude askew in the moonlight on the turf below the slanting
      monument To judge by the motions of the men engaged in the burial and the
      mocking antics of their silhouettes on the ground, it must have been
      obvious to the spectator that they were already filling in the earth. The
      interment may have seemed to him suspiciously swift, but the possibility
      was obvious that the grave might have been previously dug in anticipation
      of their arrival. It was plain that he was altogether unprepared for the
      event when they came slouching forth to the wagon, and the stalwart and
      red-faced driver, with no manifestation of surprise, hailed him as he
      still crouched in his lurking-place. &ldquo;Hello, stranger! Warn't that you-uns
      runnin' arter the wagon a piece back yonder jes a while ago?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The officer rose to his feet, with an intent look both dismayed and
      embarrassed. He did not venture on speech; he merely acceded with a nod.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye want a lift, I reckon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stranger was hampered by the incongruity between his rustic garb,
      common to the coves, and his cultivated intonation; for, unlike his
      comrade Browdie, he had no mimetic faculties whatever. Nevertheless, he
      was now constrained to &ldquo;face the music.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't want to interrupt you,&rdquo; he said, seeking such excuse as due
      consideration for the circumstances might afford; &ldquo;but I'd like to ask
      where I could get lodging for the night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's yer name?&rdquo; demanded Barker, unceremoniously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Francis Bonan,&rdquo; the raider replied, with more assurance. Then he added,
      by way of explaining his necessity, &ldquo;I'm a stranger hereabouts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye air so,&rdquo; assented the sarcastic 'Gene. &ldquo;Ye ain't even acquainted with
      yer own clothes. Ye be a town man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'm not the first man who has had to hide out,&rdquo; Ronan parried,
      seeking to justify his obvious disguise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shot somebody?&rdquo; asked 'Gene, with an apparent accession of interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's best for me not to tell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So be.&rdquo; 'Gene acquiesced easily. &ldquo;Waal, ef ye kin put up with sech
      accommodations ez our'n, I'll take ye home with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ronan stood aghast. But there was no door of retreat open. He was alone
      and helpless. He could not conceal the fact that the turn affairs had
      taken was equally unexpected and terrifying to him, and the moonshiners,
      keenly watchful, were correspondingly elated to discern that he had surely
      no reinforcements within reach to nerve him to resistance or to menace
      their liberty. He had evidently followed them too far, too recklessly;
      perhaps without the consent and against the counsel of his comrades,
      perhaps even without their knowledge of his movements and intention.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now and again as the wagon jogged on and on toward their distant haven,
      the moonlight gradually dulling to dawn, Wyatt gave the stranger a
      wondering, covert glance, vaguely, shrinkingly curious as to the
      sentiments of a man vacillating between the suspicion of capture and the
      recognition of a simple hospitality without significance or danger. The
      man's face appealed to him, young, alert, intelligent, earnest, and the
      anguish of doubt and anxiety it expressed went to his heart. In the
      experience of his sylvan life as a hunter Wyatt's peculiar and subtle
      temperament evolved certain fine-spun distinctions which were unique; a
      trapped thing had a special appeal to his commiseration that a creature
      ruthlessly slaughtered in the open was not privileged to claim. He did not
      accurately and in words discriminate the differences, but he felt that the
      captive had sounded all the gamut of hope and despair, shared the
      gradations of an appreciated sorrow that makes all souls akin and that
      even lifts the beast to the plane of brotherhood, the bond of emotional
      woe. He had often with no other or better reason liberated the trophy of
      his snare, calling after the amazed and franticly fleeing creature,
      &ldquo;Bye-bye, Buddy!&rdquo; with peals of his whimsical, joyous laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was experiencing now a similar sequence of sentiments in noting the
      wild-eyed eagerness with which the captured raider took obvious heed of
      every minor point of worthiness that might mask the true character of his
      entertainers. But, indeed, these deceptive hopes might have been easily
      maintained by one not so desirous of reassurance when, in the darkest hour
      before the dawn, they reached a large log-cabin sequestered in dense
      woods, and he found himself an inmate of a simple, typical mountain
      household. It held an exceedingly venerable grandfather, wielding his
      infirmities as a rod of iron; a father and mother, hearty, hospitable,
      subservient to the aged tyrant, but keeping in filial check a family of
      sons and daughters-in-law, with an underfoot delegation of grandchildren,
      who seemed to spend their time in a bewildering manouver of dashing out at
      one door to dash in at another. A tumultuous rain had set in shortly after
      dawn, with lightning and wind,&mdash;&ldquo;the tail of a harricane,&rdquo; as the
      host called it,&mdash;and a terrible bird the actual storm must have been
      to have a tail of such dimensions. There was no getting forth, no living
      creature of free will &ldquo;took water&rdquo; in this elemental crisis. The numerous
      dogs crowded the children away from the hearth, and the hens strolled
      about the large living-room, clucking to scurrying broods. Even one of the
      horses tramped up on the porch and looked in ever and anon, solicitous of
      human company.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I brung Ben up by hand, like a bottle-fed baby,&rdquo; the hostess apologized,
      &ldquo;an' he ain't never fund out fur sure that he ain't folks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There seemed no possible intimation of moonshine in this entourage, and
      the coffin filled with jugs, a-wagoning from some distillers' den in the
      range to the cross-roads' store, might well have been accounted only the
      vain phantasm of an overtired brain surcharged with the vexed problems of
      the revenue service. The disguised revenue-raider was literally overcome
      with drowsiness, the result of his exertions and his vigils, and observing
      this, his host gave him one of the big feather beds under the low slant of
      the eaves in the roof-room, where the other men, who had been out all
      night, also slept the greater portion of the day. In fact, it was dark
      when Wyatt wakened, and, leaving the rest still torpid with slumber and
      fatigue, descended to the large main room of the cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The callow members of the household had retired to rest, but the elders of
      the band of moonshiners were up and still actively astir, and Wyatt
      experienced a prescient vicarious qualm to note their lack of heed or
      secrecy&mdash;the noisy shifting of heavy weights (barrels, kegs, bags of
      apples, and peaches for pomace), the loud voices and unguarded words. When
      a door in the floor was lifted, the whiff of chill, subterranean air that
      pervaded the whole house was heavily freighted with spirituous odors, and
      gave token to the meanest intelligence, to the most unobservant inmate,
      that the still was operated in a cellar, peculiarly immune to suspicion,
      for a cellar is never an adjunct to the ordinary mountain cabin. Thus the
      infraction of the revenue law went on securely and continuously beneath
      the placid, simple, domestic life, with its reverent care for the very
      aged and its tender nurture of the very young.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was significant, indeed, that the industry should not be pretermitted,
      however, when a stranger was within the gates. The reason to Wyatt,
      familiar with the moonshiners' methods and habits of thought, was only too
      plain. They intended that the &ldquo;revenuer&rdquo; should never go forth to tell the
      tale. His comrades had evidently failed to follow his trail, either losing
      it in the wilderness or from ignorance of his intention. He had put
      himself hopelessly into the power of these desperate men, whom his escape
      or liberation would menace with incarceration for a long term as Federal
      prisoners in distant penitentiaries, if, indeed, they were not already
      answerable to the law for some worse crime than illicit distilling. His
      murder would be the extreme of brutal craft, so devised as to seem an
      accident, against the possibility of future investigation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reflection turned Wyatt deathly cold, he who could not bear unmoved
      the plea of a wild thing's eye. He sturdily sought to pull himself
      together. It was none of his decree; it was none of his deed, he argued.
      The older moonshiners, who managed all the details of the enterprise,
      would direct the event with absolute authority and the immutability of
      fate. But whatever should be done, he revolted from any knowledge of it,
      as from any share in the act. He had risen to leave the place, all strange
      of aspect now, metamorphosed,&mdash;various disorderly details of the
      prohibited industry ever and anon surging up from the still-room below,&mdash;when
      a hoarse voice took cognizance of his intention with a remonstrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Watt Wyatt, <i>ye</i> can't go out in the cove. Ye air dead! Ye will
      let that t'other revenue-raider ye seen into the secret o' the bresh
      whisky in our wagon ef ye air viewed about whenst 'Gene hev spread the
      report that ye air dead. Wait till them raiders hev cleared out of the
      kentry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The effort at detention, to interfere with his liberty, added redoubled
      impetus to Wyatt 's desire to be gone. He suddenly devised a cogent
      necessity. &ldquo;I be feared my dad mought hear that fool tale. I ain't much
      loss, but dad would feel it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I sent Jack thar ter tell him better whenst he drove ter mill ter-day
      ter git the meal fer the mash. Jack made yer dad understand 'bout yer
      sudden demise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yeh,&rdquo; interposed the glib Jack; &ldquo;an' he said ez <i>he</i> couldn't
      abide sech jokes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shucks!&rdquo; cried the filial Wyatt. &ldquo;Dad war full fresky himself in his
      young days; I hev hearn his old frien's say so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tried ter slick things over,&rdquo; said the diplomatic Jack. &ldquo;I 'lowed young
      folks war giddy by nature. I 'lowed 't war jes a flash o' fun. An' he say:
      'Flash o' fun be con-sarned! My son is more like a flash o' lightning; ez
      suddint an' mischeevious an' totally ondesirable.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The reproach obviously struck home, for Wyatt maintained a disconsolate
      silence for a time. At length, apparently goaded by his thoughts to
      attempt a defense, he remonstrated:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody ever war dead less of his own free will. I never elected ter be a
      harnt. 'Gene Barker hed no right ter nominate <i>me</i> fer the dear
      departed, nohow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One of the uncouth younger fellows, his shoulders laden with a sack of
      meal, paused on his way from the porch to the trap-door to look up from
      beneath his burden with a sly grin as he said, &ldquo;'Gene war wishin' it war
      true, that's why.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Count o' Minta Elladine Riggs,&rdquo; gaily chimed in another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But 'Gene needn't gredge Watt foothold on this yearth fer sech; <i>she</i>
      ain't keerin' whether Watt lives or dies,&rdquo; another contributed to the
      rough, rallying fun.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Wyatt was of sensitive fibre. He had flushed angrily; his eyes were
      alight; a bitter retort was trembling on his lips when one of the elder
      Barkers, discriminating the elements of an uncontrollable fracas, seized
      on the alternative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could you-uns <i>sure</i> be back hyar by daybreak, Watt!&rdquo; he asked,
      fixing the young fellow with a stern eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No 'spectable ghost roams around arter sun-up,&rdquo; cried Wyatt, fairly
      jovial at the prospect of liberation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye mus' be heedful not ter be viewed,&rdquo; the senior admonished him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I be goin' ter slip about keerful like a reg'lar, stiddy-goin' harnt, an'
      eavesdrop a bit. It's worth livin' a hard life ter view how a feller's
      friends will take his demise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon ye kin make out ter meet the wagin kemin' back from the
      cross-roads' store. It went out this evenin' with that coffin full of jugs
      that ye lef' las' night under the church-house, whenst 'Gene seen you-uns
      war suspicioned. They will hev time ter git ter the cross-roads with the
      whisky on' back little arter midnight, special' ez we-uns hev got the
      raider that spied out the job hyar fast by the leg.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mere mention of the young prisoner rendered Wyatt the more eager to be
      gone, to be out of sight and sound. But he had no agency in the disaster,
      he urged against some inward clamor of protest; the catastrophe was the
      logical result of the fool-hardiness of the officer in following these
      desperate men with no backing, with no power to apprehend or hold, relying
      on his flimsy disguise, and risking delivering himself into their hands,
      fettered as he was with the knowledge of his discovery of their secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's nothin' ter <i>me</i>, nohow,&rdquo; Wyatt was continually repeating to
      himself, though when he sprang through the door he could scarcely draw his
      breath because of some mysterious, invisible clutch at his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sought to ascribe this symptom to the density of the pervasive fog
      without, that impenetrably cloaked all the world; one might wonder how a
      man could find his way through the opaque white vapor. It was, however, an
      accustomed medium to the young mountaineer, and his feet, too, had
      something of that unclassified muscular instinct, apart from reason, which
      guides in an oft-trodden path. Once he came to a halt, from no uncertainty
      of locality, but to gaze apprehensively through the blank, white mists
      over a shuddering shoulder. &ldquo;I wonder ef thar be any other harnts aloose
      ter-night, a-boguing through the fog an' the moon,&rdquo; he speculated.
      Presently he went on again, shaking his head sagely. &ldquo;I ain't wantin' ter
      collogue with sech,&rdquo; he averred cautiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Occasionally the moonlight fell in expansive splendor through a rift in
      the white vapor; amidst the silver glintings a vague, illusory panorama of
      promontory and island, bay and inlet, far ripplings of gleaming deeps, was
      presented like some magic reminiscence, some ethereal replica of the past,
      the simulacrum of the seas of these ancient coves, long since ebbed away
      and vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sailing moon visibly rocked, as the pulsing tides of the cloud-ocean
      rose and fell, and ever and anon this supernal craft was whelmed in its
      surgings, and once more came majestically into view, freighted with
      fancies and heading for the haven of the purple western shores.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one of these clearances of the mists a light of an alien type caught
      the eye of the wandering spectre&mdash;a light, red, mundane, of prosaic
      suggestion. It filtered through the crevice of a small batten shutter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ghost paused, his head speculatively askew. &ldquo;Who sits so late at the
      forge!&rdquo; he marvelled, for he was now near the base of the mountain, and he
      recognized the low, dark building looming through the mists, its roof
      aslant, its chimney cold, the big doors closed, the shutter fast. As he
      neared the place a sudden shrill guffaw smote the air, followed by a deep,
      gruff tone of disconcerted remonstrance. Certain cabalistic words made the
      matter plain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;High, Low, Jack, <i>and</i> game! Fork! Fork!&rdquo; Once more there arose a
      high falsetto shriek of jubilant laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Walter Wyatt crept noiselessly down the steep slant toward the shutter. He
      had no sense of intrusion, for he was often one of the merry blades wont
      to congregate at the forge at night and take a hand at cards, despite the
      adverse sentiment of the cove and the vigilance of the constable of the
      district, bent on enforcing the laws prohibiting gaming. As Wyatt stood at
      the crevice of the shutter the whole interior was distinct before him&mdash;the
      disabled wagon-wheels against the walls, the horse-shoes on a rod across
      the window, the great hood of the forge, the silent bellows, with its
      long, motionless handle. A kerosene lamp, perched on the elevated hearth
      of the forge, illumined the group of wild young mountaineers clustered
      about a barrel on the head of which the cards were dealt. There were no
      chairs; one of the gamesters sat on a keg of nails; another on an inverted
      splint basket; two on a rude bench that was wont to be placed outside the
      door for the accommodation of customers waiting for a horse to be shod or
      a plow to be laid. An onlooker, not yet so proficient as to attain his
      ambition of admission to the play, had mounted the anvil, and from this
      coign of vantage beheld all the outspread landscape of the &ldquo;hands.&rdquo; More
      than once his indiscreet, inadvertent betrayal of some incident of his
      survey of the cards menaced him with a broken head. More innocuous to the
      interests of the play was a wight humbly ensconced on the shoeing-stool,
      which barely brought his head to the level of the board; but as he was
      densely ignorant of the game, he took no disadvantage from his lowly
      posture. His head was red, and as it moved erratically about in the gloom,
      Watt Wyatt thought for a moment that it was the smith's red setter. He
      grinned as he resolved that some day he would tell the fellow this as a
      pleasing gibe; but the thought was arrested by the sound of his own name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Waal, sir,&rdquo; said the dealer, pausing in shuffling the cards, &ldquo;I s'pose ye
      hev all hearn 'bout Walter Wyatt's takin' off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' none too soon, sartain.&rdquo; A sour visage was glimpsed beneath the wide
      brim of the speaker's hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Waal,&rdquo; drawled the semblance of the setter from deep in the
      clare-obscure, &ldquo;Watt war jes a fool from lack o' sense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That kind o' fool can't be cured,&rdquo; said another of the players. Then he
      sharply adjuxed the dealer. &ldquo;Look out what ye be doin'! Ye hev gimme <i>two</i>
      kyerds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Gene Barker will git ter marry Minta Elladine Biggs now, I reckon,&rdquo;
       suggested the man on the anvil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' I'll dance at the weddin' with right good will an' a nimble toe,&rdquo;
       declared the dealer, vivaciously. &ldquo;I'll be glad ter see that couple
      settled. That gal couldn't make up her mind ter let Walter Wyatt go, an'
      yit no woman in her senses would hev been willin, ter marry him. He war ez
      unresponsible ez&mdash;ez&mdash;fox-fire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' ez onstiddy ez a harricane,&rdquo; commented another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' no more account than a mole in the yearth,&rdquo; said a third.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ghost at the window listened in aghast dismay and became pale in sober
      truth, for these boon companions he had accounted the best friends he had
      in the world. They had no word of regret, no simple human pity; even that
      facile meed of casual praise that he was &ldquo;powerful pleasant company&rdquo; was
      withheld. And for these and such as these he had bartered the esteem of
      the community at large and his filial duty and obedience; had spurned the
      claims of good citizenship and placed himself in jeopardy of the law; had
      forfeited the hand of the woman he loved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Minta Elladine Biggs ain't keerin' nohow fer sech ez Watt,&rdquo; said the
      semblance of the setter, with a knowing nod of his red head. &ldquo;I war up
      thar at the mill whenst the news kem ter-day, an' she war thar ter git
      some seconds. I hev hearn women go off in high-strikes fer a lovyer's
      death&mdash;even Mis' Simton, though hern was jes her husband, an 'a
      mighty pore one at that. But Minta Elladine jes listened quiet an'
      composed, an' never said one word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The batten shutter was trembling in the ghost's hand. In fact, so
      convulsive was his grasp that it shook the hook from the staple, and the
      shutter slowly opened as he stood at gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps it was the motion that attracted the attention of the dealer,
      perhaps the influx of a current of fresh air. He lifted his casual glance
      and beheld, distinct in the light from the kerosene lamp and imposed on
      the white background of the mist, that familiar and individual face,
      pallid, fixed, strange, with an expression that he had never seen it wear
      hitherto. One moment of suspended faculties, and he sprang up with a wild
      cry that filled the little shanty with its shrill terror. The others gazed
      astounded upon him, then followed the direction of his starting eyes, and
      echoed his frantic fright. There was a wild scurry toward the door. The
      overturning of the lamp was imminent, but it still burned calmly on the
      elevated hearth, while the shoeing-stool capsized in the rush, and the red
      head of its lowly occupant was lowlier still, rolling on the dirt floor.
      Even with this disadvantage, however, he was not the hindmost, and reached
      the exit unhurt. The only specific damage wrought by the panic was to the
      big barnlike doors of the place. They had been stanchly barred against the
      possible intrusion of the constable of the district, and the fastenings in
      so critical an emergency could not be readily loosed. The united weight
      and impetus of the onset burst the flimsy doors into fragments, and as the
      party fled in devious directions in the misty moonlight, the calm radiance
      entered at the wide-spread portal and illuminated the vacant place where
      late had been so merry a crew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Walter Wyatt had known the time when the incident would have held an
      incomparable relish for him. But now he gazed all forlorn into the empty
      building with a single thought in his mind. &ldquo;Not one of 'em keered a mite!
      Nare good word, nare sigh, not even, 'Fare ye well, old mate!'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His breast heaved, his eyes flashed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' I hev loant money ter Jim, whenst I hed need myself; an' holped
      George in the mill, when his wrist war sprained, without a cent o' pay;
      an' took the blame when 'Dolphus war faulted by his dad fur lamin' the
      horse-critter; an' stood back an' let Pete git the meat whenst we-uns shot
      fur beef, bein' he hev got a wife an' chil'ren ter feed. All <i>leetle</i>
      favors, but nare <i>leetle</i> word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had turned from the window and was tramping absently down the road, all
      unmindful of the skulking methods of the spectral gentry. If he had
      chanced to be observed, his little farce, that had yet an element of
      tragedy in its presentation, must soon have reached its close. But the fog
      hung about him like a cloak, and when the moon cast aside the vapors, it
      was in a distant silver sheen illumining the far reaches of the valley.
      Only when its light summoned forth a brilliant and glancing reflection on
      a lower level, as if a thousand sabers were unsheathed at a word, he
      recognized the proximity of the river and came to a sudden halt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whar is this fool goin'?&rdquo; he demanded angrily of space. &ldquo;To the
      graveyard, I declar', ez ef I war a harnt fur true, an' buried sure
      enough. An' I wish I war. I wish I war.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He realized, after a moment's consideration, that he had been
      unconsciously actuated by the chance of meeting the wagon, returning by
      this route from the cross-roads' store. He was tired, disheartened; his
      spirit was spent; he would be glad of the lift. He reflected, however,
      that he must needs wait some time, for this was the date of a
      revival-meeting at the little church, and the distillers' wagon would lag,
      that its belated night journey might not be subjected to the scrutiny and
      comment of the church-goers. Indeed, even now Walter Wyatt saw in the
      distance the glimmer of a lantern, intimating homeward-bound worshipers
      not yet out of sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The saints kep' it up late ter-night,&rdquo; he commented.
    </p>
    <p>
      He resolved to wait till the roll of wheels should tell of the return of
      the moonshiners' empty wagon.
    </p>
    <p>
      He crossed the river on the little footbridge and took his way languidly
      along the road toward the deserted church. He was close to the hedge that
      grew thick and rank about the little inclosure when he suddenly heard the
      sound of lamentation from within. He drew back precipitately, with a sense
      of sacrilege, but the branches of the unpruned growth had caught in his
      sleeve, and he sought to disengage the cloth without such rustling stir as
      might disturb or alarm the mourner, who had evidently lingered here, after
      the dispersal of the congregation, for a moment's indulgence of grief and
      despair. He had a glimpse through the shaking boughs and the flickering
      mist of a woman's figure kneeling on the crude red clods of a new-made
      grave. A vague, anxious wonder as to the deceased visited him, for in the
      sparsely settled districts a strong community sense prevails. Suddenly in
      a choking gust of sobs and burst of tears he recognized his own name in a
      voice of which every inflection was familiar. For a moment his heart
      seemed to stand still. His brain whirled with a realization of this
      unforeseen result of the fantastic story of his death in Eskaqua Cove,
      which the moonshiners, on the verge of detection and arrest, had
      circulated in Tanglefoot as a measure of safety. They had fancied that
      when the truth was developed it would be easy enough to declare the men
      drunk or mistaken. The &ldquo;revenuers&rdquo; by that time would be far away, and the
      pervasive security, always the sequence of a raid, successful or
      otherwise, would once more promote the manufacture of the brush whisky.
      The managers of the moon-shining interest had taken measures to guard
      Wyatt's aged father from this fantasy of woe, but they had not dreamed
      that the mountain coquette might care. He himself stood appalled that this
      ghastly fable should delude his heart's beloved, amazed that it should
      cost her one sigh, one sob. Her racking paroxysms of grief over this
      gruesome figment of a grave he was humiliated to hear, he was woeful to
      see. He felt that he was not worth one tear of the floods with which she
      bewept his name, uttered in every cadence of tender regret that her
      melancholy voice could compass. It must cease, she must know the truth at
      whatever cost. He broke through the hedge and stood in the flicker of the
      moonlight before her, pale, agitated, all unlike his wonted self.

      She did not hear, amid the tumult of her weeping, the rustling of the
      boughs, but some subtle sense took cognizance of his presence. She half
      rose, and with one hand holding back her dense yellow hair, which had
      fallen forward on her forehead, she looked up at him fearfully,
      tremulously, with all the revolt of the corporeal creature for the essence
      of the mysterious incorporeal. For a moment he could not speak. So much he
      must needs explain. The next instant he was whelmed in the avalanche of
      her words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Te hev kem!&rdquo; she exclaimed in a sort of shrill ecstasy. &ldquo;Te hev kem so
      far ter hear the word that I would give my life ter hev said before. Te
      knowed it in heaven! an' how like ye ter kem ter gin me the chanst ter say
      it at last! How like the good heart of ye, worth all the hearts on yearth&mdash;an'
      <i>buried hyar!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With her open palm she smote the insensate clods with a gesture of
      despair. Then she went on in a rising tide of tumultuous emotion. &ldquo;I love
      ye! Oh, I <i>always</i> loved ye! I never keered fur nobody else! an' I
      war tongue-tied, an' full of fool pride, an' faultin' ye fur yer ways; an'
      I wouldn't gin ye the word I knowed ye war wantin' ter hear. But now I kin
      tell the pore ghost of ye&mdash;I kin tell the pore, pore ghost!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She buried her swollen, tear-stained face in her hands, and shook her head
      to and fro with the realization of the futility of late repentance. As she
      once more lifted her eyes, she was obviously surprised to see him still
      standing there, and the crisis seemed to restore to him the faculty of
      speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Minta Elladine,&rdquo; he said huskily and prosaically, &ldquo;I ain't dead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sprang to her feet and stood gazing at him, intent and quivering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I be truly alive an' kicking an' ez worthless ez ever,&rdquo; he went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said not a word, but bent and pallid, and, quaking in every muscle,
      stood peering beneath her hand, which still held back her hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all a mistake,&rdquo; he urged. &ldquo;This ain't no grave. The top war dug a
      leetle ter turn off a revenuer's suspicions o' the moonshiners. They put
      that tale out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still, evidently on the verge of collapse, she did not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye needn't be afeared ez I be goin' ter take fur true all I hearn ye say;
      folks air gin ter vauntin' the dead,&rdquo; he paused for a moment, remembering
      the caustic comments over the deal of the cards, then added, &ldquo;though I
      reckon <i>I</i> hev hed some cur'ous 'speriences ez a harnt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She suddenly threw up both arms with a shrill scream, half nervous
      exhaustion, half inexpressible delight. She swayed to and fro, almost
      fainting, her balance failing. He caught her in his arms, and she leaned
      sobbing against his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I stand ter every word of it,&rdquo; she cried, her voice broken and lapsed
      from control. &ldquo;I love ye, an' I despise all the rest!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I be powerful wild,&rdquo; he suggested contritely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain't keerin' ef ye be ez wild ez a deer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I'm goin' to quit gamesome company an' playin' kyerds an' sech. I
      expec' ter mend my ways now,&rdquo; he promised eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye kin mend 'em or let 'em stay tore, jes ez ye please,&rdquo; she declared
      recklessly. &ldquo;I ain't snatched my lovyer from the jaws o' death ter want
      him otherwise; ye be plumb true-hearted, <i>I know</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mought ez well hev been buried in this grave fer the last ten year' fer
      all the use I hev been,&rdquo; he protested solemnly; &ldquo;but I hev learnt a lesson
      through bein' a harnt fer a while&mdash;I hev jes kem ter life. I'm goin'
      ter <i>live</i> now. I'll make myself some use in the world, an' fust off
      I be goin' ter hinder the murder of a man what they hev got trapped up
      yander at the still.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This initial devoir of his reformation, however, Wyatt found no easy
      matter. The event had been craftily planned to seem an accident, a fall
      from a cliff in pursuing the wagon, and only the most ardent and cogent
      urgency on Wyatt's part prevailed at length. He argued that this
      interpretation of the disaster would not satisfy the authorities. To take
      the raider's life insured discovery, retribution. But as he had been
      brought to the still in the night, it was obvious that if he were conveyed
      under cover of darkness and by roundabout trails within striking distance
      of the settlements, he could never again find his way to the locality in
      the dense wilderness. In his detention he had necessarily learned nothing
      fresh, for the only names he could have overheard had long been obnoxious
      to suspicion of moonshining, and afforded no proof. Thus humanity,
      masquerading as caution, finally triumphed, and the officer, blindfolded,
      was conducted through devious and winding ways many miles distant, and
      released within a day's travel of the county town.
    </p>
    <p>
      Walter Wyatt was scarcely welcomed back to life by the denizens of the
      cove generally with the enthusiasm attendant on the first moments of his
      resuscitation, so to speak. He never forgot the solemn ecstasy of that
      experience, and in later years he was wont to annul any menace of discord
      with his wife by the warning, half jocose, half tender: &ldquo;Ye hed better
      mind; ye'll be sorry some day fur treatin' me so mean. Remember, I hev
      viewed ye a-weepin' over my grave before now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A reformation, however complete and salutary, works no change of identity,
      and although he developed into an orderly, industrious, law-abiding
      citizen, his prankish temperament remained recognizable in the fantastic
      fables which he delighted to recount at some genial fireside of what he
      had seen and heard as a ghost.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pears like, Watt, ye hed more experiences whenst dead than living&rdquo; said
      an auditor, as these stories multiplied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did, fur a fack,&rdquo; Watt protested. &ldquo;I war a powerful onchancy, onquiet
      ghost. I even did my courtin' whilst in my reg'lar line o' business
      a-hanatin' a graveyard.&rdquo;
